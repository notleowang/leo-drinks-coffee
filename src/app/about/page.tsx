					<p>I first started getting into coffee and espresso in 2020. </p>
					<p>I am by no means an expert at all. At most I consider myself a very amateur enthusiast.</p>

				<div>
					<h1>INVENTORY</h1>
					<p>This is my current home barista setup:</p>
					{/* Grinder: Turin DF64 Gen 2
					Espresso Machine: Breville Bambino */}
